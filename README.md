# My Reads 
My Reads is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes on using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library which will persist information as you interact with the application.


## How to Run
* Install dependencies: npm install 
* To start development server: npm start


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
